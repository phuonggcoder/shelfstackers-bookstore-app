# Review Edit Feature Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented the logic to prevent users from submitting new reviews if they have already reviewed a product for a specific order, and instead allow them to edit their existing review.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Product Reviews Screen (`app/product-reviews.tsx`)

#### Button Logic Improvements
- **Before**: Only showed "Viết đánh giá" (Write review) button when no review exists
- **After**: Always shows a button, but changes text and icon based on review existence:
  - If no review: "Viết đánh giá" with pencil icon
  - If review exists: "Chỉnh sửa đánh giá" (Edit review) with create icon

#### Visual Improvements
- Added different button colors: blue for new reviews, green for editing
- Added user review section with order code information
- Added prompt text for users who haven't reviewed yet
- Improved user review header with subtitle showing order context

#### Error Handling
- Enhanced `checkUserReview` function with better logging
- Graceful handling of 404/500 errors without showing alerts to users
- Proper state management for review existence

### 2. Review Form Component (`components/ReviewForm.tsx`)

#### Existing Review Support
- **Pre-filling**: Form now properly pre-fills with existing review data:
  - Rating
  - Comment
  - Images/media URLs
- **Dynamic Updates**: Added `useEffect` to update form when `existingReview` prop changes
- **Visual Indicators**: Form title and submit button text change based on mode:
  - "Viết đánh giá" vs "Chỉnh sửa đánh giá"
  - "Gửi đánh giá" vs "Cập nhật đánh giá"

#### Media Handling
- Existing images are loaded and displayed in the form
- Users can remove existing images or add new ones
- Proper state management for media URLs

### 3. Styles Added

#### Product Reviews Screen
```typescript
editReviewButton: {
  backgroundColor: '#27ae60', // Green for edit mode
},
userReviewHeader: {
  marginBottom: 12,
},
userReviewSubtitle: {
  fontSize: 14,
  color: '#666',
},
reviewActionSection: {
  marginBottom: 16,
},
reviewPromptText: {
  fontSize: 14,
  color: '#666',
  textAlign: 'center',
  marginBottom: 12,
},
```

## User Experience Flow

### For New Reviews
1. User sees "Chia sẻ trải nghiệm của bạn về sản phẩm này" prompt
2. Blue "Viết đánh giá" button with pencil icon
3. Empty form opens for new review submission

### For Existing Reviews
1. User sees "Đánh giá của bạn" section with order context
2. Green "Chỉnh sửa đánh giá" button with create icon
3. Pre-filled form opens with existing review data
4. User can modify rating, comment, and images
5. Submit button shows "Cập nhật đánh giá"

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- `userReview` state tracks existing review
- `isUpdateReview` state for thank you modal messaging
- Proper loading states and error handling

### API Integration
- `checkUserReview` endpoint to verify existing reviews
- `updateReview` endpoint for editing existing reviews
- Graceful fallback for unimplemented backend features

### Form Validation
- Same validation rules for new and edited reviews
- Rating and comment required
- Media upload limits maintained
